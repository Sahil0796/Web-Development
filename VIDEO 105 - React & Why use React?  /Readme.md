# Why React ! 
 - React is used to maake single page applications.
 - We can use states which means that once we update the variable, it changes across all the page.
 - We can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components.
 - React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating content using DOM Manipulation.
 - Debugging and maintainance becomes very easy.
